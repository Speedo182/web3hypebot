Please develop the complete, advanced code for [Web3HypeBot] in the Web3HypeBot repository. Start with the code in your response, and if it's extensive, save around 100 characters towards the end. At that point, indicate that you will continue the code in the next response. If it's 10 responses I don't care just complete it in it's fullness the code.. Once the code for the file is fully complete, confirm by stating, 'I've finished the code for [file name] and will proceed with the next file in the list.' The code should be comprehensive, detailed, and advanced, avoiding any basic or sample code unless absolutely necessary. Think ahead about how all components integrate to form the final product. Please begin with the first file handlers/__init__.py
