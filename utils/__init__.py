# utils/__init__.py

"""
Initializes the 'utils' module for Web3HypeBot.

This module contains various utility functions and helpers that are used
across different parts of the bot for tasks like parsing data, formatting
responses, and other common operations.
"""

# This __init__.py file is intentionally left with minimal content as it serves primarily to initialize the package.
# Specific utility functions and classes will be defined in other files within this module, such as helpers.py.

# Example usage in other parts of the bot:
# from utils import helpers
# result = helpers.some_utility_function()
